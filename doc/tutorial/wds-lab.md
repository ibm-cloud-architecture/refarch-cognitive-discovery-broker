# Building a Discovery Service for Weather data

IBM [Watson Discovery Service](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/discovery.html) (WDS) is a Watson service which provides the developers the ability to rapidly add a cognitive, search and content analytics engine to application to identify patterns, trends and insights from **unstructured data**, that drive better decision making.
The following [Create a collection and explore Watson Discovery tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/tutorials/cognitive_discovery/) shows how to set up and configure Watson Discovery Service and how to inject documents about hurricane and weather management.

The labs files used for creating collection of documents are under the wds-docs folder.

The current working application to demonstrate the end product of this tutorial is here: [WDS Broker on Bluemix](https://refarch-wds-broker.mybluemix.net/) or http://184.172.242.164:32571/home which is the kubernetes deployment.
